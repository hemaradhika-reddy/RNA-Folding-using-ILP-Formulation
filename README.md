# RNA-Folding-using-ILP-Formulation
In recent years, the availability of vast amounts of biological data has entered a new phase in genomic analysis and structure prediction of DNA, RNA, and proteins.  As a result, RNAs serve a critical function in regulating a variety of metabolic and signalling processes in cells.
 In this work, a simple attempt has been made to bind the fields of
Bioinformatics with Integer Linear Programming. 


This work focuses on the RNA folding problem giving insights about the
reason for RNA folding, a detailed description about the various components or loops present in the folded structure of an
RNA and the formulation of RNA folding as an ILP problem.
